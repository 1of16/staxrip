Features
========

Preprocessing
-------------

StaxRip includes demuxing GUIs for MP4Box, mkvextrakt, ffmpeg and eac3to.

The app can automatically demux all streams, show a GUI to select which streams should be demuxed or demuxing can be disabled in which case the streams are demuxed while job processing or are processed without demuxing.

Automatic demuxing with DGMPGDec, DGDecNV and DGDecIM is supported as well.

Custom preprocessing tools for demuxing, re-muxing or indexing can be integrated and configured via command line.


Video Processing
----------------

Video processing is supported via AviSynth+ and VapourSynth with AviSynth+ and VapourSynth being equally well supported.

The script code of AviSynth+ and VapourSynth can be edited directly or easily be generated via menu selection for which a profile system is available to integrate and customize custom filters and plugins.

With the help of a macro system script parameters can be changed with convenient GUI features like a resize slider and menu or a cropping dialog, due to the macro system the parameters can change at any time allowing much greater flexibility compared to a one dimensional and limiting one step after another approach.

Over 60 up to date AviSynth and VapourSynth plugin are included and ready to use.
