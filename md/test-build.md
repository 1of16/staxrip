### Fixed Bugs

- custom switches were missing in the Intel Quick Sync encoding GUI for QSVEncC
- fixed crash with ass file by replacing VSFilter with VSFilterMod

### Tweaks

- the batch audio profile uses now always batch execution, the PATH variable knows the location of ffmpeg, eac3to and BeSweet, the temp files directory is set as current directory, if input files is empty all files are excepted 
- the search feature of the apps dialog searches now also the supported filters of plugins
- enabled audio demuxing using MP4Box for mov files
- removed mkvinfo.exe which is 18 MB large and not really needed. It's large due to QT toolkit being used
- mkv audio demuxing happens now all streams together instead of every stream separate, it's much faster now.
- changed filter profiles editor to support both tab and 4 spaces for multiline profiles, tabs are converted to 4 spaces which is the standard in Python and Visual Studio
- log file improvements
- filters list view did not accept drag and drop with source files 
- enabled posibility to remux mov to mp4
- the apps dialog writes the customized versions now to the settings folder so it don't matter if the startup folder has no write access
- demuxed subtitles are now detected by ID with proper numeric order
- improved Dolby Atmos handling 
- added check if enough disk space is available before a job runs
- replaced drop down menus in Event Commands editor with menu based drop downs
