#### New Features

- added new QSVEncC switches
- added support to use network drive as temp folder
- added yadifmod for VapourSynth. Due to popular request I didn't reset the filter profiles, to make the default filter profile for yadifmod available the filter profiles must be manually reset in the filter profile editor.

#### Fixed Bugs

- fixed the check for enough free space on the disk of the target file, instead of three times the source file one time is now enough
- fixed crash StaxRip checking for enough free space in file batch mode and if target directory is network share
- fixed Umlaute don't work on Windows 7
- fixed many avs/vs scripts are created when the target file name is changed by typing

#### Tweaks
